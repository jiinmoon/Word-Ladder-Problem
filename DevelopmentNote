While implementing the Graph ADT, encountered a critical problem - that is
I cannot use single Node class to represent both Vertex and Edges.
If you do, we have a problem in connecting the edges together, and the reference
pointers when connecting edges become cyclic. Thus, we are diving into two classes
Vertex - Edges
And we are going to let each vertex have an Edges array to keep track of its own edges
and edges will keep track of where it is going to.
