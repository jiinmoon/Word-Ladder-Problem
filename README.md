# Word-Ladder-Problem


Graph ADT implementation/Graph Traversal Algorithm Project

Word-Ladder problem is a puzzle that finds a shortest route between two words using Breadth-First Search algorithm.

To solve, the graph ADT has been made in the form of Java interface, and implemented as the undirectional graph. Then, the list of words are made into the graph where individual word forms vertice and edge is made between two vertices if and only if two words are differ by only a character.

For more details about the project, do take a look at Project Proposal/Reports.
